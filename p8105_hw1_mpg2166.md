# Problem 1

## Load library and dataset

Load the `moderndive` library, and load the `early_january_weather`
dataset.

``` r
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

## Short description of the dataset

According to the dataset help file, `early_january_weather` contains
hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR.

### Summary of variables

Here are the variables included in the dataset:

- `origin` is the weather station. This is EWR for all data points.
- `year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour` represent the time of the weather
  recording.
  - `year` is 2013.
  - `month` is January, represented as 1.
- `temp` and `dewp`are the temperature and dewpoint in F.
- `humid` is relative humidity.
- `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, and `wind_gust` are wind direction (in
  degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph).
- `precip` is preciptation, in inches.
- `pressure` is sea level pressure in millibars.
- `visib` is visibility in miles.
- `time_hour` is the date and hour of the recording as a `POSIXct` date.

### Size of dataset

The size of the `early_january_weather` dataset is 358 rows by 15
columns.

### Mean temperature

The mean temperature recorded is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Scatterplot

### Create the scatterplot

Make a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs. `time_hour` (x); color points using
the `humid` variable (adding `color = ...` inside of `aes` in your
`ggplot` code should help).

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

### Interpretation

From the scatterplot, we can see that the temperature fluctuates
throughout each day, but the temperature is generally trending upward
over the timeframe. Humidity appears to stay fairly low other than a
period of a few days where the humidity is higher. The temperature
fluctuates less during that period of higher humidity.

### Save!

Export the scatterplot to the project directory.

``` r
ggsave("prob1_scatterplot.pdf")
```

# Problem 2

## Create dataframe

Create a dataframe comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
prob2_df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_logic = c(vec_norm>0),
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "a","character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "haha", "yay!"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("small", "medium", "large", "large", "medium", "small", "medium", "large", "small", "small"))
)
```

## Calculate means

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and
what doesn’t?

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_norm))
```

    ## [1] -0.0007508252

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample variable `vec_norm` and the logical variable
`vec_logic` work for calculating the mean. The character variable
`vec_char` and the factor variable `vec_factor` do not work.

## Convert variables

Write a code chunk that applies the `as.numeric` function to the
logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk but not
the output). What happens, and why? Does this help explain what happens
when you try to take the mean?

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_logic))

as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_char))

as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, var = vec_factor))
```
